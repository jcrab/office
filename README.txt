This application, once completed, will be a simple shopping cart application.  You will need to provide the ability for the administrator to add new items for sale as needed.

The administrator has a password which has been saved in the database.  You will need to retrieve that password and compare it against what is entered into the form to allow access to admin operations.

The comments marked "FIXME" should be addressed first.
